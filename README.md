- Note: Due to Kaggle’s terms of use, the raw dataset and the cleaned CSV are **not included** in this repo.
- To reproduce the cleaned dataset (`walmart_sales_clean.csv`):
  1. Download `train.csv`, `features.csv`, and `stores.csv` from Kaggle (link above).
  2. Run `notebooks/01_walmart_prep.ipynb`.
  3. The script will output `walmart_sales_clean.csv` into the `Walmart_outputs` folder.
